      <h2 class="card-title">New Album: Eternal Sunshine</h2>
      <p>Eternal Sunshine is the seventh studio album by American singer Ariana Grande. It was released on March 8, 2024, by Republic Records. It is her first new body of work in over three years, following the release of Positions (2020). Written and produced by Grande, Max Martin,
         Ilya Salmanzadeh, and Oscar Görres amongst others, Eternal Sunshine is a pop and R&B album with dance music influences, particularly synth-pop and house, characterized by mid-tempo synthesizers, subtle guitar and string elements.

        Grande derived the album's title from the 2004 American film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. She conceived the album as a record of both vulnerability and entertainment, inspired by her personal life experiences. Upon release,
         Eternal Sunshine received acclaim from critics for its restrained vocals and music, and the emotional vulnerability of the subject matter, while some critiqued the songwriting as unrefined.
        
        In the United States, the album opened at number one on the Billboard 200, marking her sixth number-one on the chart. Its singles "Yes, And?" and "We Can't Be Friends (Wait for Your Love)" debuted atop the Billboard Hot 100, making Grande the woman with the most Hot 100 number-one debuts.
         Eternal Sunshine topped the record charts in thirteen other countries. Grande promoted and discussed the album on programs hosted by radio personalities Zach Sang and Zane Lowe and was the musical guest of Saturday Night Live on March 9, 2024.
        
        The standard edition of Eternal Sunshine does not contain guest musical acts, but features spoken words from Grande's maternal grandmother Marjorie Grande on "Ordinary Things" and astrologer Diana Garland on "Saturn Returns Interlude".
         An extended edition of the album, including versions of four tracks from the standard album, was released on March 10, 2024. The additional tracks feature Australian singer Troye Sivan and American singer Mariah Carey.</p>
